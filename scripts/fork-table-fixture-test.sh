# The paths that matter on the day upstream accepts a pull request — the accepted row, the release it
# went into, the claim of the front page, the licence sentence of docs/FORK.md — are the paths nothing
# can be tried at home today, because nothing of mine is merged upstream. So the answers are written
# down: FORK_TABLE_FIXTURES points the generator at a JSON map of API path to response, and this script
# builds a scratch repository around it. The scratch upstream is a fake whose wgp.py carries
# WanGP_version, which is what an official release of this application is named by: upstream puts no
# release tag on the app, only on its manager.
#
# Three scenarios are asserted: an acceptance shipped in a release, an acceptance not yet in one and a
# closure, everything open as it is today, and every feature shipped. Nothing is fetched, nothing is
# pushed, and the repository this script lives in is not written to.
