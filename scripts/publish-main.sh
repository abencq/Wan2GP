#
# The order is the whole point. scripts/fork-pr-table.sh rewrites README.md and docs/FORK.md in the
# working tree, so a page that has just been refreshed is an uncommitted change: pushing first
# publishes the page of the previous run. So the sequence is look at the remote, generate, commit
# what the generator touched, read the pages back, push.
#
# Only the fork is ever pushed: the script refuses a remote whose URL names the upstream owner,
# because in this clone `origin` is upstream (deepbeepmeep) and `fork` is mine (abencq).

Refresh the front page and the pull-request ledger

The generator counted this fork against upstream and read the state of every pull
request from the GitHub API, so the front page and the licence record say what is
true today. The words of the front page come from docs/fork-features.md and the
rows from scripts/fork-pr-notes.json; nothing here was typed by hand.
